# ArchWSL++

**Welcome to the ArchWSL++!**  In this tutorial, you will be able to install Arch Linux in Windows Subshell for Linux using [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).  In addition, some great aesthetic and functional features that most people should know about.

For novice users, using Linux might seem like information overload, however, this tutorial is designed to make it more user friendly.  If you have about a couple of hours (maybe less) to spare, you can make using WSL so much more enjoyable and leverage its features to help you be more productive.

For experineced users, consider this a recap of everything you should probably do to quickly get up and running.

I've decided to break this tutorial in smaller parts. The parts numbered and in a sequence, with four smaller parts.

## Part 1: The Windows Part

> Almost all of the Windows part is done in Powershell.

1. [How to set up Arch Linux for WSL](Part1/01-SetupArchWSL.md) - Start Here
2. [Get a Windows Software Installer](Part1/02-GetScoop.md)
3. [Get the NerdFonts](Part1/03-GetNerdFonts.md)
4. [Install ArchWSL](Part1/04-InstallArchWSL.md)

## Part 2: The Linux Part

> Almost all of the Linux part is done in Bash or Zsh.

1. [Set up Arch Linux](Part2/01-SetupArchLinux.md) - Note: SSH, Git and Github are installed this part. How to use it, will be in Part 3.
2. [A Trip to the Toy Box](Part2/02-ToysAndTools.md) - The fun parts
3. [Zsh and Tmux](Part2/03-ZshAndTmux.md) - A better shell experience
4. [Taskwarrior](Part2/04-Taskwarrior.md) (optional) Use Taskwarrior, Timewarrior, and Taskell to manage time on projects.

## Part 3: The Node and Git Part

2. [Secure Shell](Part3/02-SSH.md)
3. [Git and Github](Part3/03-GitAndGithub.md) - We installed this eariler, but it is work taking about here.
4. [Using WSL with VSCode](Part3/04-WSLAndVSCode.md) - Putting it all together!

## Part 4. More

1. [Gitlab and Redis](Part4/01-GitlabAndRedis.md) - This section would have been just Gitlab, but Redis tagged along.

### Future parts here
- Vim
