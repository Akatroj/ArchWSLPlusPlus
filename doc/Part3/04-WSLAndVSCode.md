# Using WSL with VSCode

Well, we've come to the end of Part 3.  We covered a lot of ground.

Eventually, I will continue on into Part 4, but things become more advanced and complicated and the four-part-format starts to be come less cohesive. So let's end this with how to run VSCode with WSL.

## Running VS Code from WSL

You should run VS Code from this environment for the first time such that both applications become familiar with each other.

```bash
code .			# That is "code" space "period"
```

This will install what WSL and VS Code needs to work with each other the first time it is run. After that they should work together and you should be able to open a Linux terminal with the WSL Terminal commands. Just tell it to open Linux or Arch instead of Powershell.

> TODO: How do I set WSL/Arch as the default terminal for VS Code?

**Congratulations! You're ready to code like a pro!**

So, this is the part where the Coding Boot Camp picks up. Good luck!
