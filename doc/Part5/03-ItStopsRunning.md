# Troubleshooting Arch WSL Running Problems

(a.k.a. Why did vmmemWSL just eat all the memory and why does it keep disconnecting from VSCode.)

Honestly, this project exists still use Windows, make use of WSL, and use Arch Linux in WSL.

But leave it to Microsoft to f%$@ it all up.

Ultimately, I've decided it was worth going back to Linux because my project was using Git, Gitlab, and VSCode.

But it still suffers from the one big problem: It still runs on Windows.

Not wanting to be distracted by a News App that would show up on the left side, or put up with Windows telling me it was going to restart everying when I wasn't using it, and defintely not putting up with this crap where I leave my workspace like it was overnight only for Windows to pretend tha the virtual machine that WSL runs on "closed" and thus all my VS Code projects are "disconnected", I went back my ~~Arch Linux~~ HoloISO set up, where I don't have to deal with so many distractions and breakdowns and General Windows 11 BS.

Eventually, I woule like to create a `ArchPlusPlus` repo that shows you how to install Arch Linux the easy way.

The Linux Community has grown over the last few decades and with that growth is more software that is compatible with the open source operating system.

## OK, but I don't have time to muse on Linux stuff, how to I fix it.

Bitter pill time. You're going to need to restart.  Heck, even Microsoft Task Manager sucks. The first time I had this problem, I right clicked wanting to get a menu viewing the options I had to kill the task, only to get a white rectangle with no text in it.  The menubar, also blank. Click on "End Task" in the Details tab, BIG WHITE WINDOW SHOWS UP with nothing in it.

So nuts to that.  I saved what I could, shut down and openned back up in Linux where I can still access my C drive and other stuff.

Eventually I'll figure out this dual boot thing.

TLDR: Reboot the computer. Stay tuned for ArchPlusPlus in the near future.  Windows sucks again.
